The idea of analysing this historical event has growing in my mind after watching  former President George W. Bush accidentally switched "Ukraine" with "Iraq" in a line meant to criticize Vladimir Putin's "wholly unjustified and brutal invasion.", in a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnaqpkBmOA&ab_channel=GuardianNews">speech</a> at his presidential center in Texas.

> About dataset.

this data is published in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/oct/23/wikileaks-iraq-data-journalism">The Guardian Datablog</a>. this data is originaly leaked by <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> giving journalists and NGO 391 000 records of the Iraq War. Every minor detail is now in front of us to analyse and breakdown. I am particularly interested in the civilian dead and wounded of this war. 

<h3> $\textcolor{BurntOrange}{\text{II.1 Adding some context to every column}}$ </h3>

Column names |  My explanation after the preliminary analysis |
--- | --- |
Report Key | An Id given to the event reported |
Type   | Type of Event (Most reported events are Criminal Event) | 
Category  | Categorization of event recorded made by coalition army to help them give a title to the event  | 
Title   | A description of the event | 
Region   | Region in this dataset does not refer just to a geographic localization but to an army division  | 
Attack on   | Clustering the event to neutral, friend or enemy fire  | 
Civilian wia   | Number of civilians wounded in action  | 
Civilian kia  | Number of civilians killed in action  | 


<h3> $\textcolor{BurntOrange}{\text{II.2 Some major facts and figures}}$ </h3>

The first very disturbing observation is that 60% of the deaths in the recorded cases are civilians. In armed conflicts, the civilian - combatant ratio ( the ratio of civilian casualties to combatant casualties) is a measurment that can be applied to describe the casualties in war. I calculated it and compare it with <a href="https://wikileaks.org/"> others conflicts in the in the last century</a>


War |  The civilian to combatant fatality rate |
--- | --- |
World War II | between 3:2 and 2:1 |
Korean War   | 2:1  | 
Vietnam War  | 2:1  | 
$\textcolor{Red}{\text{Our data}}$   | $\textcolor{Red}{\text{3:2}}$ | 

this ratio should be calculated with the total dead recorded by independent organizations but it clearly demonstrates the tremendous brutality of this war, The death of two combatants in this conflict provokes the death of three civilians.

<h3> $\textcolor{BurntOrange}{\text{II.3 Analysis of the number of deaths and injuries by categories}}$ </h3>

> __Note__
> About our results.

In order to reduce the number of categories in my data, I choose to rename all incendent categories that have less that 2000 wounded persons in total to 'Other'. It will help me to do better visualisations.

In the 2003â€“2011 Iraq War, Improvised explosive devices have been used extensively against Coalition forces and by the end of 2007 they have been responsible for at least 64% of Coalition deaths in Iraq and unfortunately it wounded civilians for the simple reason, it do not directly target the enemy.
